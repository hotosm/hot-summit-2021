Our goal is to bring together the diverse users that make up the humanitarian open mapping community and to make everyone feel welcome to participate, speak up, ask questions, and engage in the event, sessions, and conversations. The growing diversity of the OpenStreetMap community includes hobbyists and professionals, people of different ethnic backgrounds and gender identities, rich and poor, etc. This is the OpenStreetMap community and are all welcome and encouraged to attend the Summit.

To achieve this we require that everyone participating in the Summit and related events treat everyone with respect and kindness and acknowledge that people from different backgrounds have different understandings of what is offensive, derogatory, and unwelcoming, and commit to bridging this through positive communication.

To ensure that the Summit and related events are welcoming and safe experiences for everyone who attends, including in this virtual environment, we have adopted the following code of conduct:
        
> The 2021 Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free virtual conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or background. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference session. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.


### Our anti-harassment policy is as follows: 
    
> Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or background; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
> 
> If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender up to expulsion from the conference.
> 
>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately by emailing us at summit@hotosm.org. 
> 
>Conference staff will be happy to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
> 
> We require participants to follow this code of conduct at all conference sessions and all conference-related events.

This anti-harassment policy is based on [the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment), created by [the Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/) and other volunteers. We also adapted some of the text from the [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/).
