The Seventh Annual Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team Summit 2021 will be held online for the second year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. This year’s theme is: **The Evolution of Local Humanitarian Open Mapping Ecosystems: Understanding Community, Collaboration, and Contribution.**

We’re looking for new and engaging online presentations, dialogues, and lightning talks. We encourage you to consider incorporating technology such as Menti (mentimeter.com), interactive boards (e.g., Jamboard, Miro), audience polling tools, etc., to maximize audience participation and interaction given our new virtual format.

Note that where possible, and especially for Failfests and Lightning talks, we will ask speakers to submit pre-recorded presentations to show at the Summit. If applicable, live Q&A will follow the presentation.

Please review important dates and proposal ideas below, then submit your proposal by the **DEADLINE: AUGUST 10, 2021**.

Please complete one form per proposal. You may submit multiple unique proposals, but understand that, due to the volume of speakers, we may only accept one submission by the same presenter(s).

If you have any questions, please email us at [summit@hotosm.org](mailto:summit@hotosm.org).
